IAM: Identity & Access Management
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  IAM is a global service in AWS. This can be verified by going to IAM Dashboard and when you try to select a region, you will see the following text
    'IAM does not require a region selection'
    It also indicates that all the users that are created in a particular AWS account are available in all regions.

    a.  The root user is the most powerful user (it can do anything and everything in an AWS account), hence its recommended to create new users to 
        perform specific tasks and limit their capabilites using policies and groups. Since we must follow the principle of least privilege.


    Q1: When creating a USER, how many types of 'Access Types' can be provisioned?
    A1: Their are two types of 'Access Types' that can be utilized

        a.  Programmatic Access: This allows the user to use AWS API, CLI, SDK and Other development tools to be utilized via an access Key ID & secret access key
        b.  AWS Management Console Access: This allows the user to use the (GUI) management console access.
    
    Q2. When creating a USER, is it necessary to Create a Group?
    A2: No, Its not necesary to create a Group while creating a USER. However, as a best practice its recommended to have even a single user to be mapped to group.
        Since over a period of time, the number of users may grow and it will be easier to manage permissions using groups and policies.
