IAM: Identity & Access Management
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  IAM is a global service in AWS. This can be verified by going to IAM Dashboard and when you try to select a region, you will see the following text
    'IAM does not require a region selection'
    It also indicates that all the users that are created in a particular AWS account are available in all regions.

    a.  The root user is the most powerful user (it can do anything and everything in an AWS account), hence its recommended to create new users to 
        perform specific tasks and limit their capabilites using policies and groups. Since we must follow the principle of least privilege.


    Q1: When creating a USER, how many types of 'Access Types' can be provisioned?
    A1: Their are two types of 'Access Types' that can be utilized

        a.  Programmatic Access: This allows the user to use AWS API, CLI, SDK and Other development tools to be utilized via an access Key ID & secret access key
        b.  AWS Management Console Access: This allows the user to use the (GUI) management console access.
    
    Q2. When creating a USER, is it necessary to Create a Group?
    A2: No, Its not necesary to create a Group while creating a USER. However, as a best practice its recommended to have even a single user to be mapped to group.
        Since over a period of time, the number of users may grow and it will be easier to manage permissions using groups and policies.
    
    Q3: What are tags in AWS?
    A3: Tags are way to organize and categorize resources in AWS.
        Foe e.g.: Their are mulitple EC2 instances in your account, and you want to identify them based on Team names and/or Project Names to quickly identify which 
        EC2 instance is being used for what. Tagging also helps to identify the cost accumulated by the resources which is important for Billing & Thresholds.
    
    Q4: Once the user is created, how many ways can the user get login credentials?
    A4: Their are two ways a user can get hold of login credentials
        a.  via the 'Download.csv'
        b.  'Send Email' : Which has the Email Login Instructions.

    Q5: How can you customize the url for specific user login, Once the user is created?
    A5: Login to the AWS console --> Go to IAM Dashboard --> on the top right under 'AWS Account' --> Look for 'Account Alias'
        a.  If you dont have an alias - It will enable the link to 'Create' an alias
        b.  If you have an alias - It will allow to 'Edit' or 'Delete' an alias

        Important Note: Since IAM is a Global Service, the alia that you create must be unique for entire IAM service across all regions.
        You cannot create an alias if it already exists.

        e.g.:   https://samarth-aws.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
    
    Q6: What is the advantage of having an alias based url for login?
    A6: Following are the advantages
        a.  When you use an 'Alias' based url:
            1.  Your 'Account ID or Alias' is already populated for you
            2.  You can directly login as an IAM user, rather than selecting the radio button between 'root user' vs 'iam user'
    
    Q7: How can you identify if a user is an IAM User vs a ROOT user, just by looking at the management console?
    A7: Once logged in, if you look at the top right of the screen where it shows the user
        a.  An IAM user will have the '@' keyword in the name:
            e.g.    samarth-developer@samarth-aws OR samarth-developer@account-id
        b.  A root user will not have the '@' keyword in the name
