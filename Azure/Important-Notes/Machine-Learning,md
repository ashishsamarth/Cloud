Machine Learning
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Example where Machine learning is used

    a. Fraud Detection

    Q#1 - Is the user making a valid transaction    : Boolean Response [Yes / No]
    Q#2 - What is the amount of the transaction
    Q#3 - Where is the transaction being carried out from?
    Q#4 - Does the user normally carry out transactions from this location?
    Q#5 - To what is the transaction being made out to ?
    Q#6 - Is this type of transaction normally carried out by the user ?

    b. Image Detection

    Providing the AI solution with an Image and evaluate the solution(s) ability to 'recognize objects'

    c. Anomaly Detection

    In the field to medicine, trying to determine if a patient is going to develop a heart disease in the future based on medical history

Machine Learning Model

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Step#1 - You feed existing / historical data [Which is labelled and has outcomes] into a Machine Learning Algorithm
    Step#2 - The Machine Learning Algorithm tires to find patterns in the data Set
    Step#3 - Machine learning model algorithm will create a model that can predict an outcome
    Step#4 - Test the ML model, to evaluate its accuracy, since end of the day its a prediction

    Key Considerations:
    a. Data should be relevant to the problem being solved.
    b. Their should be enough data points to help develop the model
    c. Data should be free of errors
