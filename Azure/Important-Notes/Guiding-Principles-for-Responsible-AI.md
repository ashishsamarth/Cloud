Guiding Principles for Responsible AI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    a. Accountability : Whatever solution you have built as an AI solution, is not the final deciding factor. As a human being you are accountable for the solution that you have created
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

    b. Reliability & Safety : Lets say you built a crucial solution for a health care provider, to perform certain diagnosis, as a solution creator you need to ensure, that the solution that you have built is reliable (performs everytime) and aligns with the safety standards of the target ecosystem
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

    c. Privacy & Security: Usually AI / ML works with a lot of data which is very likely to have sensitive data. As a AI solution we should align with the Privacy & security of that data. For e.g. Credit Card Anomaly detection & Alerting for PCI-DSS
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

    d. Transparency : When you are building an AI solution, it shouldn't be the case that only a handful people understand the AI solution and whats its meant to be used for. The entire team working / supporting that AI solution should understand the input / output / specifications / dataset / Algorithms, so that their is complete transparency around the AI solution
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

    e. Inclusiveness : When you are utilizing some dataset to build an ML solution, then you must ensure to include all potential aspects and variations in the dataset. The idea is to NOT have any bias in the AI / ML solution, and the AI solution is able to cater to majority scenarios, its utilized for.
    ------------------------------------------
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------         
    f. Fairness : When building an AI solution, apart of being 'Inclusive' to everybody, another important principle is to be 'Fair' [During Implementation] to everybody
